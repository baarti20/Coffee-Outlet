CoffeeOutlet Project
=====================

Project Title
-------------
CoffeeOutlet – A static, responsive website for a café / coffee shop.

Overview
--------
CoffeeOutlet is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present a clean and visually appealing landing page for a café. The site displays menu items, café ambience, contact information, and incorporates basic interactivity. The goal is to provide a polished front-end that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Features
--------
- Responsive design: adapts layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- Navigation menu for easy movement between sections (e.g. Menu, About, Contact).  
- Menu section showing coffee/beverages, with images and descriptions.  
- About section to present café story / mission / background.  
- Contact section with address / phone / email info.  
- JavaScript interactivity: e.g. menu toggling (for small screens), smooth scroll behavior.  
- Consistent theme and styling (color scheme, typography, spacing) for a unified design.  

Technologies Used
-----------------
- HTML5 – for the page structure.  
- CSS3 – styling, layout, responsive media queries.  
- Vanilla JavaScript – for behavior and interactivity.  
- Local image assets (photos, icons etc.).
